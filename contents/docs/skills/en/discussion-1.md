1. **Thumb Up/Like Icon**: This serves only as appreciation for the student's answer and does not contribute to their grade. If you only give a **Thumb Up**, the student will not receive any points.
2. **Reply**: Use this feature to leave comments on the student's answer.
3. Displays the timestamp of when the student submitted their answer.
