2. **Practice Quiz**: A quiz that is completed after accessing the material, serving as practice before taking the Post-Quiz.
3. **Post-Quiz**: A quiz that must be completed after accessing the material.

To start a quiz, you can click on the **Pre-Quiz** in the Course Content Session.

3. Remaining Attempts: You can retake the quiz if allowed, but Pre-Quizzes and Post-Quizzes can only be attempted once.
4. Grading Method: For quizzes with multiple attempts (e.g., Practice Quizzes, which allow up to three attempts), the highest score among all attempts will be recorded as your final grade.
5. Quiz Duration: Each quiz has a designated duration. If you exceed the allotted time, the quiz will automatically end, and you will not be able to continue answering.
