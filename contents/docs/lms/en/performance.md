The dashboard also includes a Performance column. This menu is useful for reviewing students' performance and study duration in each class. Instructors can also see the number of assignments completed by each student in this menu.

1. Study Hour : This section displays the student's study duration.
2. Quiz : This section also shows the number of completed assignments compared to the total available assignments (*e.g., in the Quiz section: 3/12, meaning the student has completed 3 quizzes out of 12 required quizzes*). The same applies to other types of assignments (e*.g., Discussions, Individual Assignments, Midterm Exams, Final Exams*).
